        <p>This Certification and License Agreement (“Agreement”) is a binding contract between ________ LLC (“SP”) and
            the individual or entity that completes and submits an online application for the People Coach Program and
            indicates acceptance of this Agreement by checking the applicable box or otherwise electronically accepting
            this Agreement (“Applicant”).</p>

        <p>By checking the box or otherwise electronically accepting this Agreement as part of the Application (as
            defined below), Applicant acknowledges that Applicant has read, understands, and agrees to be bound by the
            terms and conditions of this Agreement. If Applicant is entering into this Agreement on behalf of an
            organization, the individual accepting this Agreement represents and warrants that they have the authority
            to bind that organization, and “Applicant” will refer to that organization.</p>

        <p>This Agreement is effective as of the date on which the Application of Applicant is approved and accepted by
            SP (“Effective Date”).</p>

        <h2>1. Background</h2>
        <p>SP is an affiliate of Science of People LLC (“SP Parent”), which specializes in researching and teaching body
            language, communication skills, analysis of micro-expressions, analysis of personalities, and methods of
            thinking, as well as various other “people-related” skills and strategies. Based upon scientific research
            identified, culled, and analyzed, SP Parent created and compiled unique curricula of learning modules and
            other tools that are the subject of copyright protection by either SP Parent or its founder and owner,
            Vanessa Van Edwards (“Edwards”), which include but are not limited to ideas, concepts, literary works,
            visual works, musical works, audio materials, audio recordings, knowledge, know-how, methodologies,
            processes, trade secrets, trademarks, service names, trade names, logos, service marks, and brand names
            (collectively, “Intellectual Property”), and which SP (via license from SP Parent) teaches using specific
            methods, devices, and tools (“SP Methodology”) across various platforms to a diverse demographic base of
            viewers, students, professionals, and members of the general public.</p>
        <p>SP has developed a premium, curriculum-only license and certification program (“People Coach Program”) that
            will provide experienced coaches with specific curricula, slides, facilitator guides and workbooks,
            handouts, assessments, tools, and related content, including all future updates, revisions, translations,
            abridgements, and other derivative works (collectively, the “Program Materials”) to assist their teaching of
            others using the SP Methodology. The Intellectual Property, the SP Methodology, the People Coach Program,
            and the Program Materials, and its related assets, as well as any and all related rights, processes,
            know-how, methods of operation, intellectual property rights, patent, copyright, trademark, trade secrets,
            and all associated rights and goodwill, as well as any and all derivative works related thereto (including
            Applicant Materials) shall be referred to herein as the “SP Assets”.</p>
        <p>Applicant desires to complete the People Coach Program on the terms and conditions set forth herein.</p>

        <h2>2. Enrollment, Certification, Renewal, and Revocation Process</h2>
        <p>(a) Application. To register for the People Coach Program, Applicant shall electronically submit an
            application through SP’s website at _____________ (“Application”) and pay an enrollment fee in the amount of
            $9,995.00 (“Enrollment Fee”). The Application will provide (i) a payment portal for the Enrollment Fee and
            (ii) a clickable and downloadable link to a copy of this Agreement and will require Applicant’s express
            agreement and confirmation (via a check box or other electronic means) to be bound by the terms and
            conditions of this Agreement. The Enrollment Fee shall not be refundable in whole or in part and for any
            reason, except in the event the Application is not approved by SP. If SP approves the Application, SP shall
            send Applicant an electronic notice of approval, along with details of the People Coach Program, including
            the timing for the training sessions, the password and other information needed to access the People Coach
            Program, and instructions on how to begin the educational process.</p>
        <p>(b) Certification. Applicant shall have unlimited access to the Program Materials for one year following the
            date Applicant has received all of the Program Materials (“Training Period”) to complete the People Coach
            Program (including obtaining a passing score on all testing) and to apply for a Certificate of Compliance
            (“Certificate”) confirming that Applicant (i) has completed the People Coach Program and is certified to
            teach the SP Methodology and (ii) has been granted a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, non-assignable,
            non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use the Program Materials to teach the SP
            Methodology (“IP License”) on the terms and conditions set forth herein. All aspects of the process of
            obtaining a Certificate (“Certification Process”) shall be in the sole discretion of SP. If Applicant does
            not successfully complete the Certification Process on or before the expiration of the Training Period,
            Applicant may not use any part of the SP Assets under any circumstances. If Applicant successfully and
            timely completes the Certification Process, SP shall provide Applicant with a Certificate confirming that
            Applicant has been certified to teach the SP Methodology and received an IP License for the Authorized Use
            only and for a one-year period following the last day of the Training Period (“Certification Period”),
            subject to the right of SP to suspend or revoke the Certification as provided herein.</p>
        <p>(c) Renewal. To continue to teach the SP Methodology, Applicant must renew the Certification Period on an
            annual basis (“Renewal”). Prior to the end of the then current Certification Period, SP will send Applicant
            an electronic notice (“Renewal Notice”) informing Applicant that Renewal is due and setting forth the
            renewal fee in the amount of $500 to be paid by Applicant within 30 days of the date of the Renewal Notice
            (“Renewal Fee”) as well as the information about a renewal exam that must be successfully passed by
            Applicant within 60 days of the date of payment of the Renewal Fee (“Renewal Exam”).</p>
        <p>(d) Review. SP reserves the right to conduct a review of Applicant’s use of the Program Materials, the SP
            Methodology, and the Intellectual Property at any time upon reasonable notice to Applicant in order to
            determine if Applicant is in compliance with all of the terms and conditions hereof (“Review”). Applicant
            shall cooperate in all respects with the Review, shall act reasonably and in a professional and timely
            manner with all requests by SP in connection with the Review and shall make the non-financial books and
            records of Applicant’s business with respect to the use of the Program Materials, the SP Methodology, and
            the Intellectual Property available at the times and in the manner required by SP as part of the Review. If
            SP determines that Applicant is in violation of any of the terms of this Agreement, Applicant shall promptly
            comply with any requests and corrective actions from SP.</p>
        <p>(e) Suspension or Revocation. SP may at any time and in its sole discretion suspend or revoke Applicant’s
            Certification for any of the following reasons: (i) breach by Applicant of any term of this Agreement; (ii)
            misuse by Applicant of any of the SP Assets; (iii) failure by Applicant to take any corrective actions
            required by SP within the time frame specified by SP; (iv) use by Applicant of any of the SP Assets in a
            manner that is beyond the scope of the IP License, outside of the Authorized Use, and/or otherwise
            inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (v) failure by Applicant to timely pay any
            Renewal Fee or pass any Renewal Exam; and/or (vi) any comment(s) made by Applicant (written or oral) about
            any of the SP Assets, SP, and/or any of SP’s principals, owners, affiliates, officers, directors, managers,
            employees, agents, representatives, licensees or assigns (collectively, “SP Parties”), which is (are)
            derogatory, damaging, disparaging, defamatory, embarrassing, ridiculing or which otherwise bring any of the
            SP Parties into disrepute and/or damage or potentially damage their reputation (public and/or private),
            standing in the community, their goodwill, and/or their brand. If SP at any time suspends or revokes
            Applicant’s Certification with electronic notice, Applicant shall immediately cease and desist from any
            further use of or association with any of the SP Assets.</p>
        <p>(f) Substitution. If Applicant leaves the employment of an organization, the organization may request the
            substitution of another employee as a certified coach with a Certification, so long as the request is made

            payment of $1,000 to SP, and the substituted coach completes the People Coach Program (including obtaining a
